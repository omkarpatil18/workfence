# WorkFence
This was a startup I co-founded during COVID in 2020. The aim was to gamify "social distancing" in workplaces through an app.

WorkFence is a tool for shared workspaces/factories, places where co-workers are required to be together for work. It will monitor Social Distancing at workplaces, during work hours. It will capture every event of not distancing, so as to train workforce/teams to work-collaborate with distancing. Workfence takes no personal information, and shares no data (except with designated administrators in the organization). Workfence monitors only at the designated place of work, at designated work times. The system is developed by using BLE (BlueTooth Low energy protocol), and advanced, robust algorithms. The WorkFence mobile app is developed by technocrats with two decades of experience, along with a team of bright students from IIT Madras, developing this proprietary algorithm with complex mathematical modeling.
